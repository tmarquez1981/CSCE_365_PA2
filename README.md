# CSCE_365_PA2

Temporary notes(Ben):
I'm not sure we will need to make a full UML, classes are laid out. The Sender class inherits from BasicSender.
I say we start with just going down the bullet points she gave, coding in BasicSender. We can then make the sender a state machine, similar to TCP state machine
  in the textbook. Maybe nearly exact, I haven't looked close enough yet thinking about UDP. State-machine to code should be simple and get us the extra credit
  for variable sliding window.
I think one of us has to start, so my idea was to plan out one bullet point minimumally and just dive into coding it. That will give us a more defined Sender class
to do the rest of the bullet points. Then we code the state machine around it once it is functioning sending one packet at a time.
